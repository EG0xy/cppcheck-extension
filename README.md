# cppcheck README

This extension utilizes the cppcheck static code analyzer to provide C and C++ code analysis within Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Run cppcheck for a single file.
- Run cppcheck for the entire workspace.
- On the fly linting within the code editor.

## Requirements

Cppcheck must be installed. Any version may be used. The extension will try to locate the `cppcheck` executable if
possible. On Windows, it will search the 32-bit and 64-bit Program Files directories. On Linux and macOS, several
bin directories will be searched.

If `cppcheck` is not found, `cppcheck.cppcheckPath` must be set to the correct location of the executable.

### Windows Installation

Cppcheck is available for download at [`cppcheck.sourceforge.net`](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/).

### Ubuntu Installation

For Ubuntu users, Cppcheck is available via `apt-get`.

```sh
sudo apt-get install cppcheck
```

### macOS Installation

For macOS users, Cppcheck can most easily be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install cppcheck
```

### Linting

The linter can be enabled by setting 'cppcheck.lintingEnabled' to true. This can be done either globally in user
settings, or per-workspace in workspace settings. The current recommendation is to enable linting per-workspace.

## Extension Settings

* `cppcheck.enable`: Enable/disable the analyzer.
* `cppcheck.cppcheckPath`: The path to the cppcheck executable.
* `cppcheck.includePaths`: The paths to any include directories.
* `cppcheck.platform`: The compilation platform. This determines data types and sizes (e.g. sizeof(int)).
* `cppcheck.standard`: The language standard to use (e.g. c++11).
* `cppcheck.define`: Symbols to define for the preprocessor.
* `cppcheck.undefine`: Symbols to undefine for the preprocessor.
* `cppcheck.suppressions`: Any cppcheck rules to suppress (see the cppcheck manual).
* `cppcheck.verbose`: Enable verbose output from cppcheck.
* `cppcheck.force`: Enable forcefully analyzing all possible configurations through cppcheck.
* `cppcheck.showStatusBarItem`: Show/hide the status bar item for displaying analyzer commands.
* `cppcheck.lintingEnabled`: Whether to enable automatic linting for C/C++ code. Linting runs on workspace changes and file saves.
* `cppcheck.outputCommandLine`: Whether to output the command line used to invoke Cppcheck.
* `cppcheck.language`: Force 'cppcheck' to check all files as the given language.
* `cppcheck.inconclusive`: Allow reporting even though analysis is inconclusive. May lead to false positives.
* `cppcheck.severityLevels`: Maps the severity levels of cppcheck to VSCode severity levels (Error, Warning, Information, Hint). Setting to 'None' will not show the severity type at all.

### A quick note on paths

When using the `includePaths` setting, variables will be expanded once. Anything embedded will be used as is.
In addition to any environment variable being expanded, `${workspaceRoot}` will also be expanded.
